/**
 * This service is responsible for keeping xmtp group chat members in sync with the members of a safe.
 *
 * We first have a method to allow a xmtp group chat to be created with a list of members.
 *
 * Then we have a method to check for pending members (members that failed to be added to the group chat i.e. are not
 * yet on XMTP v3). This method will be used to retry adding the members to the group chat and is run on a schedule.
 *
 * Finally we have another method that periodically checks for new members in a safe and adds them to the group chat.
 * Or removes members from the group chat if they are no longer in the safe.
